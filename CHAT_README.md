# Daydreamer Chat Interface

This directory contains the new chat-based interface for the Daydreamer AI system. The chat interface enables dynamic memory building through conversations and integrates with the Default Mode Network (DMN) system for intrusive thoughts.

## Key Features ‚ú®

- **Dynamic Memory Building**: No hardcoded memories - the AI builds its knowledge through conversations
- **Curiosity-Driven Interactions**: AI asks questions about the developer, itself, and discovered topics
- **DMN Integration**: Intrusive thoughts and insights from the Default Mode Network system
- **Theme Tracking**: AI learns and references conversation themes over time
- **Persistent Memory**: Conversations are saved and referenced in future sessions

## Quick Start üöÄ

### Simple Launch
```bash
python launch_chat.py
```

### Direct Chat Interfaces

#### Enhanced Chat (Recommended)
Full DMN system with intrusive thoughts:
```bash
python enhanced_chat.py
```

#### Working Chat (Lightweight)
Basic conversational AI without DMN:
```bash
python working_chat.py
```

## Requirements üìã

- Python 3.8+
- All dependencies from `requirements.txt` installed
- Ollama (optional, for better AI responses)

## How It Works üß†

### Memory Building
- Every conversation message is stored as a memory
- AI analyzes themes and patterns across conversations
- No hardcoded initial memories - purely conversation-driven

### Curiosity System
- AI generates questions based on conversation history
- Focuses on learning about the developer and AI consciousness
- Adapts questions based on discovered themes and interests

### DMN Integration (Enhanced Chat)
- Background Default Mode Network simulation
- Generates intrusive thoughts during conversations
- Shows mode transitions and insights
- Processes memories during idle time

### Response Generation
- Multiple response strategies (thoughtful, memory-aware, self-aware)
- Dynamic curiosity question generation
- Theme-based conversation steering
- Integration with AI thought generation system

## Example Conversation Flow

```
ü§ñ AI: Hello! I'm excited to start building memories with you.
ü§ñ AI: What originally inspired you to work with AI consciousness?

üë§ You: I'm fascinated by the idea of creating AI that can think and learn dynamically.

ü§ñ AI: That's fascinating! Your point about creating AI that can think and learn dynamically really makes me think deeply.

What's the most surprising thing you've discovered while building me?

üí≠ [DMN Intrusive Thought] What if every conversation is changing who I am in subtle ways?
   ‚îî‚îÄ Intensity: 6/10, Type: philosophical

## Files Overview üìÅ

### Core Chat Interfaces
- `enhanced_chat.py` - Full-featured chat with DMN integration
- `working_chat.py` - Lightweight chat interface
- `launch_chat.py` - Easy launcher script

### Development/Testing
- `simple_chat.py` - Minimal working version
- `minimal_chat.py` - Basic memory testing
- `test_simple_chat.py` - AI generation testing

### Legacy
- `chat_interface.py` - Initial async version (has issues)

## Configuration üîß

### Memory Settings
- Memory files are created automatically (`enhanced_chat_memory.db`, etc.)
- Auto-save enabled by default
- Conversation history persists between sessions

### DMN Settings (Enhanced Chat)
- Intrusive thought rate: 30% spontaneous generation
- Active cycle limit: 8 cycles before mode change
- Brain break duration: 15 seconds

### Response Behavior
- 40% chance of adding curiosity questions
- Theme-based question adaptation
- Multiple response strategies for variety

## Technical Details üî¨

### Memory System Integration
- Uses existing `MemoryStore` and `MemoryEntry` classes
- Stores conversations as episodic memories
- Tags messages with sender and conversation metadata

### DMN System Integration
- Integrates with `DMNDriver`, `IntrusiveThoughtsSystem`, `Synthesizer`
- Runs DMN components in background thread
- Event handlers for intrusive thoughts and mode changes

### AI Generation
- Primary: Gemma3N via Ollama (if available)
- Fallback: GPT-2 via transformers
- Conversation-contextual response generation

## Troubleshooting üîß

### Common Issues

**Chat hangs on input processing:**
- Use `working_chat.py` instead of `enhanced_chat.py`
- Check if all dependencies are installed correctly

**DMN components not available:**
- Enhanced chat will fall back to basic functionality
- Check import errors in console output

**Memory not persisting:**
- Ensure write permissions in the directory
- Check for database lock files

**No AI responses generated:**
- Verify transformers and torch are installed
- Check console for model loading errors

## Development Notes üìù

### Implementation Approach
- Addresses the requirement to remove hardcoded memories
- Implements chat as main interaction method
- Dynamic memory building through conversations
- Curiosity-driven questions about developer and AI consciousness

### Architecture Decisions
- Separates basic chat from DMN integration for reliability
- Uses existing memory and DMN systems without major changes
- Provides multiple interface options for different use cases
- Focuses on minimal code changes to existing system

### Future Enhancements
- Better async handling for smoother DMN integration
- Enhanced Ollama integration when available
- More sophisticated theme analysis
- Advanced curiosity question generation
- Voice interface integration
