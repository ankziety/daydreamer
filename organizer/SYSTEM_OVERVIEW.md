# Daydreamer Organizer Agent System - Complete Overview

## 🎯 System Purpose

The Organizer Agent system is designed to break down the Daydreamer project into discrete, well-scoped tasks suitable for parallel development. It provides a comprehensive task management system that allows builders to:

1. **Identify their team** and get personalized task assignments
2. **View detailed task information** with complete builder prompts
3. **Understand dependencies** and development order
4. **Get Git instructions** for proper branching and workflow
5. **Access all necessary information** to begin work immediately

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Task Registry** (`task_registry.json`)
   - Central database of all tasks
   - Organized by workstreams and teams
   - Contains detailed builder prompts and requirements

2. **Builder Assignment System** (`builder_assignment.py`)
   - Python-based task retrieval system
   - Supports filtering by team, priority, and dependencies
   - Generates formatted task output

3. **Builder Setup System** (`builder_setup.py`)
   - Interactive team identification
   - Personalized welcome and task overview
   - Configuration persistence

4. **Shell Script Wrappers**
   - `get_tasks.sh`: Easy task viewing interface
   - `setup_builder.sh`: Simple builder setup interface

## 📊 Task Organization

### Workstreams

The project is organized into 5 main workstreams:

1. **Core Engine (CE)** - 3 tasks
   - Foundation for all other systems
   - Agent lifecycle and simulation management

2. **Memory System (MS)** - 2 tasks
   - Long-term and working memory management
   - Persistence and retrieval systems

3. **Scheduler (SC)** - 2 tasks
   - Task scheduling and resource management
   - Priority queues and allocation

4. **UI System (UI)** - 2 tasks
   - Web dashboard and CLI interfaces
   - Monitoring and control systems

5. **AI Integration (AI)** - 2 tasks
   - Model integration and intelligence framework
   - Behavior trees and decision-making

### Builder Teams

4 teams with different focuses and capacities:

- **Builder Team A**: Core Engine & AI Integration (High Capacity)
- **Builder Team B**: Scheduler & Communication (Medium Capacity)
- **Builder Team C**: Memory System & Intelligence (Medium Capacity)
- **Builder Team D**: UI System & Interfaces (Low Capacity)

## 🔄 Task Dependencies

Tasks are carefully organized with dependencies to ensure proper development order:

```
CE-001 (Agent Class) ← No dependencies
├── CE-002 (Simulation Engine)
├── CE-003 (Communication)
├── SC-001 (Task Scheduler)
└── AI-001 (Model Integration)

MS-001 (Memory Store) ← No dependencies
└── MS-002 (Working Memory)

SC-001 (Task Scheduler)
└── SC-002 (Resource Manager)

CE-002 (Simulation Engine)
├── UI-001 (Web Dashboard)
└── UI-002 (CLI Interface)

AI-001 (Model Integration)
└── AI-002 (Intelligence Framework)

MS-001 (Memory Store)
└── AI-002 (Intelligence Framework)
```

## 🚀 Builder Workflow

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Run the setup script
./organizer/setup_builder.sh

# This will:
# - Ask for your name (optional)
# - Show available teams
# - Let you select your team
# - Display personalized welcome
# - Save your configuration
```

### 2. View Your Tasks
```bash
# View all tasks for your team
./organizer/get_tasks.sh "Builder Team A"

# View detailed information
./organizer/get_tasks.sh "Builder Team A" --detailed

# View specific task
./organizer/get_tasks.sh --task CE-001

# Create standalone task file
./organizer/get_tasks.sh --task CE-001 --create-file
```

### 3. Start Development
```bash
# Follow Git instructions from task
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b feature/ce-001-core-agent-class
git push -u origin feature/ce-001-core-agent-class

# Implement according to builder prompt
# Write tests and documentation
# Submit pull request to dev branch
```

## 📋 Task Structure

Each task contains:

```json
{
  "task_id": "CE-001",
  "description": "Implement core Agent class with basic lifecycle management",
  "builder_prompt": "Detailed implementation instructions...",
  "dependencies": [],
  "priority": "High",
  "assigned_to": "Builder Team A",
  "branch": "dev",
  "estimated_hours": 16
}
```

### Builder Prompt Components

Every builder prompt includes:

1. **Task Summary**: Clear description of what to build
2. **Required Interfaces**: Classes, enums, and methods to implement
3. **Input/Output**: Data formats and expected results
4. **Verification**: Test requirements and acceptance criteria
5. **Timeline**: Estimated completion time
6. **Git Instructions**: Exact commands for branching

## 🛠️ System Features
