# Integration Module - Agent Information

## Overview
Integration module provides clean interfaces for different AI model backends including Ollama and Transformers with fallback support.

## Components
- `ollama_integration.py` - Ollama client and model management with fallback to Transformers

## Current Status
- Files moved from root directory
- Import paths need updating
- Model integration is functional but needs path updates

## Active Tasks
1. Update import statements to reflect new directory structure
2. Test Ollama and Transformers integration
3. Ensure proper fallback mechanisms
4. Test model switching functionality

## Dependencies
- Ollama library (optional)
- Transformers library (optional)
- Core system for model requests
- AI engines for model usage

## Rules for Integration Module
- Maintain clean abstraction over different model backends
- Ensure proper fallback when preferred models are unavailable
- Keep model switching functionality working
- Update all import paths to use relative imports

## Important Notes
- Supports both Ollama and Transformers backends
- Provides automatic fallback when preferred model is unavailable
- ModelManager class coordinates between different backends
- Used by both AI engines for model calls

## Next Steps
1. Update import statements in ollama_integration.py
2. Test Ollama integration
3. Test Transformers fallback
4. Test model switching functionality
